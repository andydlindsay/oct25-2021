# W02D04 - Promises

### To Do
- [x] Illustrate the "callback waterfall" (callback hell) problem
- [x] Introduction to Promises
- [x] Error handling with Promises (vs callbacks)
- [x] Parallelizing async things (Promise.race and Promise.all)
- [x] Creating our own Promises

### Promises
* An alternative for async code
* Uses a callback
* 2015 as part of ES6
* prior to 2015 bluebird

* Can exist in three states: fulfilled, rejected, awaiting/pending
* Promises are objects
* `.then` returns a Promise


1. make it work
2. make it pretty
3. make it fast (big O notation, algo complexity)

homogenous code (eslint)
