# W10D01 - Rails Review

### To Do
- [ ] "Rails Week" Conversation
- [ ] MVC Review
- [ ] Quickly build simple Rails app
- [ ] Nested Resources

### Rails Week Convo
* convenient
* rails was fun
* using active record
* wish we had more control
* rails is automagical (when it works)
* wish Ruby required brackets
* errors are more informative than Ruby
* migration is lovely
* really liked the rails console
* looks like Django (Python)
* hate working on erb files

### MVC
* Model - our data, way of interacting with the db
* View - our web page, user interface, templates
* Controller - the brain, communicates with both model and view
